/* Firefox's user interface can be modified by editing the 
 * userChrome.css and userContent.css files in 
 * ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_dir>/chrome/ 
 *
 * PROFILE_DIR is of the form hash.name, where the hash is an 
 * 8 character, seemingly random string and the profile name 
 * is usually default. You can find out the exact name by 
 * typing about:support in the URL bar, and searching for the 
 * Profile Directory field under the Application Basics  
 *
 * 
 *  The chrome/ folder and userChrome.css/userContent.css files 
 *  may not necessarily exist, so they may need to be created.
 *
 *  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets must be 
 *  enabled in about:config.
